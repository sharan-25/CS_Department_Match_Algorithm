# CS_Department_Match_Algorithm
This Java project implements a matching algorithm for assigning professors to available courses in La Salle College's Computer Science Department. The algorithm considers professor preferences, course availability, and constraints such as seniority and requested hours.
# Features
Matching Algorithm: Efficiently assigns courses to professors based on their preferences and availability.
Professor Representation: Represents professors with attributes such as ID, name, seniority, and list of affected courses.
Course Representation: Represents courses with attributes such as ID, title, discipline, hours, and number of groups.
Department Representation: Represents the Computer Science Department with a course map and list of professors.
# Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Java installed.
Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
Run the main application to process professor preferences and course availability.
Review the output to see the assignments made by the algorithm.
